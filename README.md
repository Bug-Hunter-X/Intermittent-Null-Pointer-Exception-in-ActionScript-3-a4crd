# Intermittent Null Pointer Exception in ActionScript 3

This repository demonstrates an uncommon ActionScript 3 bug involving an intermittent null pointer exception.  The variable `myObject` unexpectedly becomes null, despite what appears to be a correct assignment in the code.  The problem only manifests under certain conditions, making it difficult to debug.

The `bug.as` file contains the problematic code, which produces the error when running under specific circumstances (detailed in the `bugContent` within the json file).  The `bugSolution.as` file presents possible solutions and workarounds to the problem.

## Potential Causes

* **Asynchronous Operations:** The issue might stem from asynchronous operations where `myObject` is assigned later than expected. Consider using events or callbacks to ensure proper timing and synchronization.
* **Garbage Collection:**  Aggressive garbage collection might prematurely release the object before its usage.  Check for memory leaks or unintended deallocation of `myObject`.
* **Event Handling:** The method may be being called prior to the correct object being added to the display list or before the event listener is fully initialized. Consider re-examining event listener registration.
* **Conditional Assignments:** The assignment of `myObject` might be dependent on a conditional that isn't always met, resulting in an unexpected `null` value. Examine any `if` or `else` statements governing the assignment.
* **Concurrency issues:** If the object is being accessed by multiple threads or processes, unexpected nulls can result. Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (rare in AS3, but still possible).
* **External Libraries/APIs:** If third party libraries or APIs are involved, these may contribute unexpected behaviors. Check documentation and examples to rule this out.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run `bug.as`.  The specific conditions causing the error are described in detail in `bugContent` section in json file.
3. Compare with the corrected solution provided in `bugSolution.as`
