function handleComplete(event:Event):void {
  //Solution:  Use a conditional check to handle potential null values.
  if (myObject != null && myObject.someProperty != null) {
    trace(myObject.someProperty);
  } else {
    //Handle the case where myObject or someProperty is null
    trace("myObject or someProperty is null");
  }
}

//Further Solution:  Investigate the assignment of 'myObject'. Ensure it's assigned correctly and at the appropriate moment. 
//This might involve using event listeners or callbacks in the event handling flow or adding logging to ensure all conditional statements execute correctly
//If the object's creation is asynchronous, consider using an event listener or callback mechanism for when 'myObject' is ready before accessing it's properties.
